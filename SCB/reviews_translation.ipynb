There was only one machine on site. Today I encountered someone whose card was stuck in it. The bank staff was very slow and no one came to deal with it. I When I asked the guard that the machine was broken again, the guard actually told me that the machine was broken by a customer. That was ridiculous. The machine should be replaced.

Other banks allocate time deposits to exclusive areas. There is so much business at the counter, no wonder the efficiency is not fast. If the bank does not review the internal business planning, I will not even think of giving it a star. Everyone comments.
